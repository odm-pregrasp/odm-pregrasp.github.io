section_title1: "Abstract"
section_description1: "Due to the high Degree of Freedom (DoF) of dexterous hands, controlling them to complete manipulation tasks is highly challenging. With the outstanding learning capabilities, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is widely employed to do dexterous manipulation tasks. The high DoF of dexterous hands bring exploration difficulties to DRL, which leads to the DRL convergence problem. Carefully designed pre-grasp poses can help bypass the initial exploration stage, thereby reducing the task difficulty and alleviating the DRL convergence problem. However, current methods for obtaining pre-grasp poses are costly but of low quality. In this paper, we design an automated method for generating high-quality task-free and finger-level pre-grasp poses based on the desired grasps. A desired grasp of one object is the hand pose in the object frame when humans manipulate this object in daily life. It is not only the grasping method expected by the designer, but also a practical way to hold the object discovered by humans after long-term exploration in different tasks. Utilizing the desired grasp information of an object to generate pre-grasp poses facilitates the rapid formation of a stable grasp pose during various tasks, reducing the DRL convergence difficulty. To evaluate the method, we apply our generated pre-grasp poses on three dexterous manipulation tasks with different objects. The results demonstrate that our pre-grasp poses effectively contribute to DRL convergence among all three tasks, surpassing all other baselines or closely matching the best baseline."
section_title2: "Method"
section_description2: "(a) Acquiring critical information including the contact point set and the desired orientation from the desired grasp. <br>(b) Obtaining pre-grasp poses through initialization and optimization. <br>(c) Filtering pre-grasp poses by numerical screening and simulation screening."
section_description3: "We integrate pre-grasp poses from our method into DRL training for dexterous manipulation to demonstrate their efficacy. We employ the Adroit Hand as our dexterous manipulator and Mujoco as the simulator for DRL training. In this setup,  we construct an environment featuring a table measuring 0.45m x 0.45m, upon which lies an object to be grasped. We conduct experiments using three objects (a hammer, a knife and a flute) and three manipulation tasks (relocation, following trajectory and desired grasp). "
